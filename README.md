An encounter manager for Star Wars role playing games.


## Requirements
* Java: 11
* Maven: 3.5.x

## Build
Build with `mvn clean install`

Build for production with `mvn clean package -Pproduction`

## About the Code
I've started to create the code with the German terms inside the source code because this software has been made with a German copy of the Star Wars Role Playing rule books (by FFG). But I've changed this while coding and getting access to English rule books. So don't wonder finding those some of this German words inside the code :)

You'll find a translation file in the projects root folder.

## Open Issues

* Button to remove an encounter.
* Combo box to select an encounter in the encounter input view.
* Change to English terms consequently.
* User management and authentication.
* Added constant combatant modifications (like 'Adversary' talent oder defense values).
